I collected a complete set of Alibaba Cloud vector icons and generated the draw.io icon library.

## Background

In many well-known diagramming software (such as draw.io, Lucidchart, Gliffy, ProcessOn, etc.), there is no built-in Alibaba Cloud official vector icons.  
So I collected a complete set of Alibaba Cloud vector icons and generated the draw.io icon library.
