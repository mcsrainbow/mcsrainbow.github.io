## Preface

"The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind" is a work of social psychology by French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon, first published in 1895. Le Bon lived in an era shortly after the end of the French Revolution. People experienced the French Revolution from the storming of the Bastille to the Thermidorian Reaction, and French history entered a period of safeguarding the achievements of the Revolution, where the voice of the masses began to gain dominance and people had the opportunity to enter political life. A century later today, the historical context described by Le Bon still applies and has developed even further.

The term "crowd" refers to a group of people gathered together like crows, describing a collection of individuals who come together without organization or discipline, are easily manipulated, and lack independent thinking. The core viewpoint of this book is: individuals in a crowd lose their rationality and independence, becoming dominated by emotion, suggestion, and the collective unconscious, thus displaying blind, impulsive, and irrational behavior.

## Summary

Le Bon argues that the behavior of crowds is fundamentally different from individual behavior. When a person is an isolated individual, they have their own distinct personality characteristics, but when this person merges into a crowd, all their personality traits are submerged by the group, and their thoughts are immediately replaced by the crowd's thoughts. When a crowd exists, it has characteristics of being emotional, unanimous, and of low intelligence.

However, Le Bon's entire book almost only presents his own viewpoints, lacking quantitative and systematic research. Compared to works with systematic analytical arguments, Le Bon is more akin to proposing viewpoints. As Freud commented on this book, Le Bon, as a discoverer of problems, pointed out important aspects of crowd life but did not provide explanations for them.

## Thinking

Reading a book is not just about acquiring information; more importantly, it's about integrating the essence of the book into our own thinking and life. Therefore, we need to approach every work with a prudent attitude.

"The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind" reminds us to constantly be aware in real life: Are we currently part of a certain crowd? What characteristics does the crowd exhibit? In such an atmosphere, how do we leverage the collective advantages while being vigilant about potential blind spots? Maintaining clarity and rationality, learning to think independently, allows us to "cultivate ourselves" in an environment of following the crowd, and still maintain "harmony in diversity" while integrating into the group.
