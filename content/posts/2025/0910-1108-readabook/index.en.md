## Introduction

"How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading" was published by American philosopher Mortimer J. Adler in 1940, advocating for the improvement of personal thinking and learning abilities through systematic reading.

The book proposes four levels of reading: Elementary(Basic) reading, Inspectional(Review) reading, Analytical reading, and Syntopical(Subject) reading, and provides reading strategies for different types of books.

## Summary

This book covers a very broad topic. The gap from Elementary(Basic) reading to Syntopical(Subject) reading is like the difference between a middle school student and a graduate student. Syntopical(Subject) reading goes beyond just "reading a book" and belongs more to research methods rather than reading techniques. The writing can be quite wordy, so the book may not be worth reading cover to cover. Checking out mind maps might be enough.

## Reflections

The four levels of reading from "How to Read a Book: The Classic Guide to Intelligent Reading" offer real practical value. These are Elementary(Basic) reading, Inspectional(Review) reading, Analytical reading, and Syntopical(Subject) reading. Inspectional(Review) reading helps quickly decide if a book deserves deeper attention, saving time on low-value books. Analytical reading helps understand and absorb key ideas from important books more thoroughly.

I plan to apply these reading methods to my actual reading practice, improving my reading efficiency and gaining more valuable knowledge in less time. More importantly, I will use this as an opportunity to develop sustained reading habits in the future. Through extensive reading, I will continuously expand my knowledge boundaries, enrich my cognitive structure, and cultivate sharper thinking abilities along with a broader perspective.
