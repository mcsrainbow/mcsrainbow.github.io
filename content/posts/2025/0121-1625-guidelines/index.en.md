Good work guidelines help cultivate deep thinking and professional behavior.

---

- **Principle-minded**  
  Focus on the "why" behind things, not just "how".  
  This helps enhance problem-solving skills and makes decisions more forward-looking and adaptable.

- **Ticket-minded**  
  Track all tasks through tickets, rather than relying on emails or chats.  
  This keeps work organized and transparent, making follow-up easier.

- **Automation-minded**  
  Use tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks, avoiding manual operations.  
  This saves time, increases efficiency, and reduces errors.

- **Reliability-minded**  
  Back up all data, and ensure every change has a rollback plan.  
  This minimizes the risk of unexpected failures and prevents irreversible damage.

- **Test-minded**  
  Every change must be tested.  
  Experience, trust, and confidence are all unreliable.

- **Concise-minded**  
  Prioritize screenshots, mind maps, flowcharts, architectural diagrams, and tables when documenting and presenting information.  
  Clear visual communication is more efficient and easier to understand than lengthy text.

- **Knowledge-minded**  
  Document experiences, acquired knowledge, and lessons learned.  
  This will prevent repeated mistakes, improve efficiency and transparency, and boost the team’s overall capability.
  
- **Team-minded**  
  Properly dividing tasks and collaborating helps avoid over-reliance on any individual and efficiently accomplish seemingly impossible tasks.  
  One person may go faster alone, but a team can go further together.
