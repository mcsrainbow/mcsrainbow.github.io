## Preface

Eric Ries, author of "The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses", co-founded IMVU, a 3D avatar virtual social platform, where he also served as CTO. His background includes roles as Entrepreneur-in-Residence at Harvard Business School and providing business and product strategy consulting to startups, large companies, and venture capital firms.

The book breaks down the startup process into a simple cycle: "Ideas - Build - Measure - Learn - New ideas". The core approach focuses on turning ideas into basic product versions with minimal investment, getting these products to market quickly, and collecting real user feedback. Based on this feedback data, startups can rapidly shift direction, improve products, and discover what customers actually want. The key message is clear: startups need to find valuable business insights as quickly and cheaply as possible before running out of money.

## Summary

Lean Startup changes how people think about starting businesses by offering a scientific approach to deal with the high uncertainty that new ventures face. The core philosophy rests on five principles: entrepreneurs exist everywhere, entrepreneurship requires management, learning must be validated, the "Build-Measure-Learn" cycle drives progress, and innovation needs proper accounting. This approach uses scientific testing instead of gut feelings to check business ideas, turning entrepreneurship from talent-based art into learnable, repeatable science.

In practice, Lean Startup centers around the "Build-Measure-Learn" cycle. This involves creating Minimum Viable Products (MVP) to quickly test markets and gather real user feedback, using innovation accounting to track progress, and making data-driven decisions about whether to change direction or keep going. This process works alongside three growth methods (sticky, viral, and paid) and small-batch work styles to help startups learn the most while spending the least time and money, avoiding the waste common in traditional startup approaches.

Lean Startup goes beyond product development - it's a management approach for building learning organizations. Tools like "Five Whys" create continuous learning systems, balancing quality with speed while building innovation culture. Both startups and large companies can use this methodology to boost innovation success rates, cut project failures, and create lasting business value.

In modern product development practices, Lean Startup can integrate with advanced methodologies "Design Thinking" and "Agile":

- Design thinking is used to deeply understand users, clarify needs, and inspire creativity;
- Lean Startup is used to transform creativity into viable business models;
- Agile development efficiently implements ideas into products through rapid iteration and continuous delivery.

## Thinking

After reading "The Lean Startup," I have gained a completely new understanding of entrepreneurship. As the book states, "Validated Learning" is the most valuable asset for new ventures, not those elaborate plans and complex features based on assumptions. This has given me a profound understanding that entrepreneurship is essentially a process of continuous learning and experimentation under extreme uncertainty.

I will continue to enrich my business knowledge, and keep an open mindset to embrace failure and change. Hopefully, at some point in the future, I can apply what I've learned to create my own business venture.
